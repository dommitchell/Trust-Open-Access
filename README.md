# Trust-Open-Access
A little add-on using various datasets to display how trusted a journal is - very prototype.

## What it can do

Using DOAJ Data, Beal data (JUST FOR FUN/TESTING) it can show notifications (see yes/no response) and content based on if a site is "trusted" or not based on this data (if it's not on those lists, it won't give a response). This is only meant to display basic functionality, and not in any way represent the actual datasets we might use.   

###Test sites

http://bmjopen.bmj.com/ (yes)
google.com (nothing)
scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=0001-3765&script=sci_serial (Ok)
rapidintellect.com/AEQweb (No) 

### How to use

1. Install it, as below. (Uninstall any prior OAB you have. This is necessary for testing.)
2. Open it, and log in if needed
3. Browse to test sites - a yes/no/okay may appear on the icon
4. Click the button on the page to display a fuller response.
